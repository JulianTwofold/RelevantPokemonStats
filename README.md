# Relevant Pokemon Stats
The Base Total Stat is not as usefull as it could be considering that there are practicaly no mixed attacker running around. Relevant Stats finds out the lower attack stat and turns it off. The user can also turn off other stats such as speed, to find out the best trick room sweepers for example. While this tool can be usefull, its main purpose is to let the user have fun by toing around.

Koraidon, Miraidon, Slaking, Palafin-Hero, Blissey and Chansey got removed, because it was anoying that they always showed up at the top. Pokemon with a BST lower than 430 got removed to, to increase performance. Only Pokemon that are in the paldean dex are listet.
